INTRO
==========

NMapper application is demonstrating the normal mapping technique using Qt5.

- Includes few example images and matching normal mapped textures.
  To test own images, use "[image].png" add "[image]n.png" filenames, copy
  them into images directory and add into Qt5_NMapper.qml imageFiles array.
- With the UI it's possible to change the lighting conditions, move the
  light and scale the output image to see how the normal mapping shader
  behaves.
- If you want to utilize this in your own Qt5 QML application:
  Copy NMapEffect.qml and NMapLightSource.qml, use your images with
  suitable lighting settings and implement rest of the UI. You can also
  edit the NMapEffect shader to suit your own needs.


RUNNING
==========

To run this application you need relatively recent build of Qt5:
- http://qt-project.org
- http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

There are two different ways to run the application:

1) If your target platform contains 'qmlscene' binary, just use it:
---
cd Qt5_NMapper
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmlscene Qt5_NMapper.qml
---

2) Alternatively, a simple launcher is provided to start the application:
---
cd Qt5_NMapper
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmake
make
./Qt5_NMapper
---

The run application in fullscreen mode, use '--fullscreen' parameter for 
qmlscene or launcher. If you want to tweak the window resolution, 
modify 'width' and 'height' properties in Qt5_NMapper.qml
