INTRO
==========

NMap Carousel application is demonstrating the normal mapping technique
using Qt5. Normal mapping is used for making the icons appear 3D with
lighting and shadows. To increase this impression, there are also extra
shadows reflected behind the icons.

If you want to utilize this in your own Qt5 QML application:
Copy NMapEffect.qml and NMapLightSource.qml, use your images with
suitable lighting settings and implement rest of the UI. You can also
edit the NMapEffect shader to suit your own needs.


RUNNING
==========

To run this application you need relatively recent build of Qt5:
- http://qt-project.org
- http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

There are two different ways to run the application:

1) If your target platform contains 'qmlscene' binary, just use it:
---
cd Qt5_NMap_CarouselDemo
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmlscene Qt5_NMap_CarouselDemo.qml
---

2) Alternatively, a simple launcher is provided to start the application:
---
cd Qt5_NMap_CarouselDemo
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmake
make
./Qt5_NMap_CarouselDemo
---

The run application in fullscreen mode, use '--fullscreen' parameter for 
qmlscene or launcher. If you want to tweak the window resolution, 
modify 'width' and 'height' properties in Qt5_NMap_CarouselDemo.qml
